                <h2>Iconic Alpine Trails</h2>
                <p>
                    From the famous Tour du Mont Blanc to the lesser-known but equally stunning trails in the Dolomites, the Alps provide endless opportunities for trail runners. Each region offers unique landscapes, from lush valleys to rugged peaks.
                </p>

                <h2>Must-Visit Locations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chamonix Valley, France</li>
                    <li>Zermatt, Switzerland</li>
                    <li>Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy</li>
                    <li>Innsbruck, Austria</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Seasonal Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    The best time for trail running in the Alps is typically from June to September, when most trails are snow-free and weather conditions are most favorable. However, early season runners should be prepared for variable conditions and possible snow at higher elevations.
                </p>

                <h2>Safety and Preparation</h2>
                <p>
                    Alpine trail running requires careful preparation. Always check weather forecasts, carry appropriate gear, and be aware of altitude effects. Many trails are well-marked, but having navigation skills and a map is essential for safety.
